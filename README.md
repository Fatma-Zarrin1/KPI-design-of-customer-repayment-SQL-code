This project implements a Collection Efficiency (CE) KPI framework using SQL with Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
The objective is to analyze collection performance across partner banks and identify underperforming segments using structured financial and operational metrics.

The analysis calculates demand, collections, efficiency ratios, and shortfall contributions to support management decision-making and incentive planning.
